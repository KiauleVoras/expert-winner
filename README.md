Huzuni 3.5
Huzuni is a Minecraft Griefing client originally developed by Halalaboos and co-developed by brudin, his bff. Originally a private client was made by the two entitled ‘Poohbear’, but after a freak accident, it was no longer developed. Thus we’ve moved onto making a new client and using the event system from the original client. I guess you could say it’s just poohbear renamed, but it really is not. Now, its a free Minecraft griefing client made to suit your needs when it comes to griefing.
